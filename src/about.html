        <h2>The International Space Station</h2>

        <p>
          It is the largest modular space station in low Earth orbit. The
          project involves five space agencies: the United States' NASA,
          Russia's Roscosmos, Japan's JAXA, Europe's ESA, and Canada's CSA. The
          ownership and use of the space station is established by
          intergovernmental treaties and agreements. The station serves as a
          microgravity and space environment research laboratory in which
          scientific research is conducted in astrobiology, astronomy,
          meteorology, physics, and other fields. The ISS is suited for testing
          the spacecraft systems and equipment required for possible future
          long-duration missions to the Moon and Mars.

          The station is divided into two sections: the Russian Orbital Segment
          (ROS) is operated by Russia, while the United States Orbital Segment
          (USOS) is run by the United States as well as by the other states. The
          Russian segment includes six modules. The US segment includes ten
          modules, whose support services are distributed 76.6% for NASA, 12.8%
          for JAXA, 8.3% for ESA and 2.3% for CSA. The length along the major
          axis of the pressurized sections is 218 ft (66 m), and the total
          volume of these sections is 13,696 cu ft (387.8 m3).
